##Common typos on a danish keyboard, these chars are either physically next to on another (like a and s), or can be gotten by accidentally holding down shift or alt (like 4 $ and ¤ on a danish keyboard), sound similar (like b and p) or look similar (like o and 0)
##In a fuzzy text comparison, swapping any of these characters should be considered a smaller difference, than swapping two very different characters

##Each line tells us that the first char can be swapped with any of the latter (but the latter are not seen as close to each other)

##For example, the line: 'wesvaW' Tells us that w and a could easilly be swapped, and w and e could also be swapped (both are physically very close to the w key), but it doesn't say anything about a and e
##The next line 'erd3sE' does not contain w, because w has already been marked as a neighbour of e in the previous line

##Empty lines, and Lines beginning with ## are ignored (if you hadn't guessed)

##The program can not handle non-ascii characters
